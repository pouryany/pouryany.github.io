## Bio

I am a postdoctoral research fellow supervised by Winston Hide at the [Non-coding RNA Laboratory](https://www.hidelab.net/). My research focuses on network and pathway models for analysis of genomic data in complex diseases. Currently, I am working on models for understanding the role of non-coding RNAs in resilience to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and finding potent therapeutic interventions that can alter disease mechanisms in AD.
